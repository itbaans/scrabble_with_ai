# Scrabble Program README

## Introduction
Welcome to our Scrabble Program, an implementation of the world's fastest Scrabble algorithm developed by Andrew W. Appel and Guy J. Jacobson. This program is written in Java and provides an engaging platform to play Scrabble against a highly efficient AI opponent.

## Getting Started
just run the .jar file to play !

## Files
- **moves.txt:** This file is regularly updated with the moves placed on the board, along with their respective scores, until the game concludes.
- **horiMoves.txt:** Displays all possible horizontal moves that can be placed on the current board state.
- **verMoves.txt:** Displays all possible vertical moves that can be placed on the current board state.

## How to Play
- Launch the game by running the `.jar` file.
- To make the AI move just click on the robot icon :P
- Check the `moves.txt` file to keep track of the game's progress.

## Contributions
This Scrabble Program was developed as part of a data structures project. Contributions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to explore and enhance the codebase.

## Acknowledgments
Although this was the Data Structures project, I would like to thank our ITC teacher Sir Jawwad Ahmed Farid for sharing this amazing resource to implement the algorithm.

Have fun playing Scrabble! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
